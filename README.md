# VPass

A parking and visiting logs mobile application for the Bulacan State University.

## Getting Started

Just like any existing flutter app. You just have to install dependencies for this application.

```
flutter pub get
```

To build a copy for android you have to clean first the project:

```
flutter clean
```

Then build the apk:

```
flutter build apk
```

Copy the ".env.example" file and rename it ".env". The backend application of this app is in [VPass API](https://github.com/cruzaljon1990/vpass-web).
